I understand that this is a series and it's going to answer each question like where is Allie and is she going to come back, and where and what is going on with Greta (Josh's sister) in each of their own stories I just thought we could have got a bit of a wrap up. I would have liked more of a conclusion between Devon and her dad and also with Josh. It kind of just ended with her revelation and didn't show the future or anything which I really enjoy a the end of the books I read. This book just ended very abruptly for me and unfortunately that negatively affected my overall outlook on the book.I don't think I will read Allie's story because I already don't really like her. I mean okay she ran off on her wedding day and that's a dick move to someone you claim to care about but I was more upset with the fact that she dated her best friends ex-boyfriend. She was fully aware how those two felt about each other but she decided to date him and then get married to him in less than a year and asked Devon to be at the wedding. All of those things are just not okay in my book. Especially when she clearly wasn't in love with Josh, I think that makes it all the more worse.So unfortunately for me my questions will remain unanswered when it comes to this series.\n"
